# Next.js Project Starter - With Stitches

Please check the `main` branch for key documentation. This branch uses [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) for styling and has a simple example of a button with different variants and utils to get you started.

## Folder Structure

The project contains a simple page with a `Button` component to showcase the expected structure of the project.

Folder structure is exactly the same as `main`, however, each component no longer has a separate `.module.css` file and instead has Stitches styling embedded in the main `.tsx` file.
